  At the moment I am mostly working with React and have some experience
  with Redux, React Router and React Native.`,

  Javascript.`,

  `I have some experience with CRUD in Postgres and a basic understanding of GraphQL. I also like to make use of
  Node.js and Express in Google Cloud Functions, mostly as proxies for
  third party API's that do not support CORS.`,

  `I use Github for version control and have experience with the peer
  review process.`,

  `I was introduced to Google Cloud Platform at a previous place of work. I
  enjoy using Firebase, Firestore and Kubernetes in my personal projects.
  I also have a few apps that use Google Maps.`
